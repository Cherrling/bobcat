Description: run-time (shared) Bobcat library
 The (shared) Bobcat library contains classes and templates used by, e.g., the
 Stealth and Bisonc++ programs.
 .
 The Bobcat library contains a variety of C++ classes and templates, some of
 them based on well-known Design Patterns. The library offers classes
 handling, e.g.,
    Child Processes, Forks, Pipes and Redirection
    Command-to-Function associations
    Command-line arguments and history handling
    Command-line editing using streams
    Configuration Files
    Decryption and Encryption
    Extended String Operations
    Hash-tables
    Integers of unlimited size
    File-descriptor based streams (e.g. handle sockets using streams)
    Mail headers and mail filtering (milters)
    Message Digests
    Pattern matching
    Processes, Signals, Threads
    Shared Memory
    Single (Direct) Key Input
    Syslog- and other kinds of messages
    Temporary files
    Universal Type Conversions (Templates)
